# Business Plan: Universal BMS Terminal Device

### 1. Executive Summary

We aim to develop a **universal BMS Terminal device** to simplify the management of battery packs from various vendors. Our primary users are individuals and businesses in the renewable energy sector who utilize off-grid setups. The device will be supported by an **open-source Python library TinkerBMS**, currently under development, capable of reading multiple BMS protocols, ensuring compatibility and ease of use.

### 2. Problem Statement

Currently, users face challenges in reading battery status and controlling inverters due to the diverse and often incompatible BMS programs provided by different battery vendors. These programs typically support only a single type of BMS and have outdated interfaces. Our major competitor, Victron, offers dbus-serialbattery software on their Venus OS, which is limited in BMS support and usability across different platforms.

### 3. Solution

Our solution is a versatile BMS Terminal device that can be implemented on PCs, SBCs like Raspberry Pis, or microcontrollers using MicroPython. This device will use an open-source Python library to read various BMS protocols, providing a unified and user-friendly interface for battery management. Our main selling points are interoperability, versatility, and a vendor-agnostic BMS data reader.
